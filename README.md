A mod for *Lethal Company* which upgrades the ship's scanner, allowing it to scan lifeforms in addition to scrap.

## Installation

Place `ScanPlus.dll` in your `BepInEx/plugins` folder.

Alternatively, you can use Thunderstore Mod Manager.

## Usage

To use the upgraded scanner the player must purchase the `Infrared Scanner` ship upgrade. Doing so will add information about which creatures are spawned on the current moon.

The need for the `Infrared Scanner` upgrade can be disabled in the config file (see below), allowing for the enhanced scan without having to purchase the upgrade.

## Configuration

`ScanPlus.cfg` will be generated after runnning *Lethal Company* for the first time after installing this mod, allowing for several changes to be made:

* Switch between `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, and `Excessive` levels of detail in the upgraded scan messages. 

* Enable/Disable need for ship upgrade to use enhanced scanner.

* Adjust price of the `Infrared Scanner` ship upgrade (if enabled).
